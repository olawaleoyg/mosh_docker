## BUILD YOUR FIRST DOCKER IMAGE

Open your vscode, download one quickly if you dont have that.

get a package.json that you intend to you for your image, depending on what you intend to build.

save it in the vscode with package.json, then create a Dockerfile
go to docker hub and search alpine, reason for this instead of node full package, we don't want to download a heavy file that could be about 200-300mb or more instead we get a lightweight file "alpine"

then build that on your terminal

cd to the directory of your choice, for mine I'm using react-app directory
run this

# react-app % docker build -t react-app .
